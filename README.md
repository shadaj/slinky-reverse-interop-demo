# Slinky Reverse Interop
This project demonstrates the reverse interop capabilities of Slinky, where your Scala.js code exposes React components that can be used from regular JavaScript code.

The `main.jsx` file shows how to import components from Scala.js and use them, and the `src/main/scala/hello/world/Main.scala` file shows how to export Slinky components from Scala.js code.
